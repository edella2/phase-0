### What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

##### Information Gathering

Determine the purpose of the site, what it's goals are, who the target audience is and what content you will display.

##### Planning

Create a site map and list all the main topics you will address in your site.  You will also decide things like what CMS(content management system) you will incorporate.

##### Design

Create a site aimed at your target audience.  Set your site in a way that it will give you ways to  express your likes and dislikes through the design.

##### Development

Typically develop your homepage and a shell for interior pages.  Elements decided upon during the planning stage will be implemented such as the CMS or interactive forms.

##### Testing and Delivery

 Test for complete functionality of forms and scripts as well as compatibility issues between different web browsers and devices.  The file will then be uploaded to a server and tested again.

##### Maintenacne

Updating content on the site through a CMS to make any changes or additions to existing content.



### What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The goal of my site is to work as an addition to my resume.  It will have a blog to my experiences working as a web developer and it will have links to my portfolio as well as sites and other projects I was involved in.  


### What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience will be potential employers or customers looking for a web developer.  My site will focus on my skills and experiences as a web developer and host my portolio.


### What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The goal of my site is to have the user to contact me.  To do this I want users to interact with my portfolio and resume on the site to generate interest to contact me.  I want users to also to get to know me and will have a blog that will give them a window into my life.


### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

A site should not just be pretty or flashy, but should provide an ease of use.  People access sites through many different ways.  It is important your site remains accessible to all people such as people with special requirements such as screen readers.  

### What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

UX design is how your users will experience your website.  It helps keep people interested in your site and interact with it more. It is beneficial for everyone, an example for businesses would be that if your site provides a poor experience they may try a competitor who may have an easier and more pleasing site.


### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I used WriteMaps to create my site map.  There are some usability things with their page that created issues and took away from my experience as a user on their site.  There were issues with creating and deleting projects on their site where the drop down menu would disappear when I hovered over the actions I wanted to take.  This is something I can learn from in the future for sites I work on for issues I should be aware of.  In a purely UX criticism of the site I really enjoyed the lay out of the home page and it made it easy to navigate through to the areas I wanted to go to.

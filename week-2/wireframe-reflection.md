### What is a wireframe?

It is a visual outline of a website.  While it is not functional it provides a way for people to imagine the flow and layout of a site without actually creating any code.

### What are the benefits of wireframing?

You can plan what features will display on a page without writing a single bit of code.  It helps save time by creating a plan and layout.  

### Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I did!  It was a lot of fun moving things around with some of the wireframe tools out there and deciding which one I liked the most.

### Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I actually did revise my wireframe a few times.  I had tried a couple different wireframe tools before using Balsamiq.  I liked their tool the best. 

### What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I asked the rest of the Copperheads which tools were their favorites.  A few had mentioned Basalmiq and I decided to give that a try.  I liked it so much I redid my wireframe with their tool.

### Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I found just finding which wireframe tool to use the most tedius.  But I really did enjoy it once I found one that felt right for myself.

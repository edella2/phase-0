  <!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

I enjoyed it.  It was my first time actually using HTML to make something.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

It was good, it make it easier to identify different elements in our code.  Knowing that the header tag refers to just the header makes it really easy to navigate through everrything without loading the page.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

We did well, all the tags were tabbled making it easy to navigate.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

It seems great for making a foundation of a site.  But really poor in making it look nice.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

Always create the closing tag right away so you don't miss it later.

## REFLECTION

#### What is a one-to-one database?

A one-to-one relationship would be similar to the state and region problem we did in 8.4.  In this situation you have many states, but they can only belong to one region.

#### When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

You would use one-to-one relationship when you want assign a large term like region to many smaller important terms. An example would be like identifying characteristics of a child.  They have one father, but the father can have several children each with their own specific characteristic like, date of birth, their name, favorite color and father's name.

#### What is a many-to-many database?

many-to-many databases will often have a join table to connect all the tables together

#### When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

You could use it for cocktail recipes.  One table for the cocktails that might have the strength and number of ingredients.  And one table for the ingredients and their proof.

#### What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?

It was my first time using a schema before, the website seemed pretty intuitive and the concept of shcemas is interesting.  With that said creating many-to-many tables as confusing at first.  It makes more sense now as sometimes tables will have their own unique information.  But will also be connected to other tables in other ways.

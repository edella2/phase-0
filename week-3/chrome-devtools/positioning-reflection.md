#3.4 Chrome Dev Tools


### How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

Chrome DevTools is very useful in finding different positions for elements and visually seeing what is changing for each thing you enter.   For someone like myself that does not know or understand all the CSS commands yet, it is very helpful to visually see what changes.

### How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You can edit the parent of the tree to change all the children to be a different size. 

### What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

`Absolute positioning` - Elements are considered to be out of normal flow of a document.  They are positioned relative to their nearest ancestor and if one doesn't exist to the initial container.

`Fixed positioning` - Is often used to create floating elements that stay in the same place even when scrolling through a page.  The viewport is considered to be the container for the element.

`Static positioning` - is the inital value for CSS elements.  It is laid out in the current position in the flow and top, right, bottom, left and z-index properties do not apply.

`Relative positioning` - this lays out all elements as though they were not positioned and then adjust the elements position according to the changing layout.

### What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

`Padding` is space that is created with in an element.  
`Border` is the edge of the element.  
`Margin` is the space outside of the border.

### What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

This challenge was very much love and hate.  Getting the boxes to go to the appropriate sides was very challengeing and *very frustrating*.  But once we got each element in the correct position I felt very excited for what we could do with our own sites.

	      What are the benefits of version control?
	    </h3>
	    <p>
	      Version control allows you to track and manage changes made to a file.  Version control is extremely beneficial for working on a project with a large group.  It helps protect the master branch and provides a form of back up if it is needed to revert to an earlier version.

	    <h3>
	      How does git help you keep track of changes?
	    </h3>
	    <p>
	        Git is a form of version control.  By allowing people to work on a project in different branches it helps protect the master from potentially harmful changes.  Git also provides ways of tracking changes through commits.

	    <h3>
	      Why use GitHub to store your code?
	    </h3>
	    <p>
	        GitHub is great for storing code that multiple people will work on as a team.  It is also useful for people that may change which computer they are developing on periodically, by storing the information remotely.  GitHub takes the benefits of version control from git and allows the work to be saved remotely instead of locally.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

For creating our index pages and blog pages for last weeks solo challenge.  I used the header and footer tag.  I just found this site today with other tags and their descriptions that I found useful and plan to use in the future.  http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_new_elements.asp

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The elements get laid out on a page from top to bottom.  This is how the browser displays them.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist? 

I think creating and using snippets will be something I use regularly for sublime.  One of my favorite snippets for creating a block of text is using lorem(tab) to create a block of text.  You can even use Loremx10(tab) to create a sentance of 10 words.

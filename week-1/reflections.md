# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

##### Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
I learned about the pomodoro technique to really focus on a task for 25 minutes and take a 5 minute break and I learned about creating tiny habits to help achieve a major goal.  

##### What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
Time boxing is working an agreed period of time, alone or with a team, on a goal and stopping at the end of the time to reflect on what was accomplished in that period.  

##### How do you manage your time currently?
Currently I do not use any specific technique and have just focused on self motivation to accomplish tasks and goals.  While it has worked so far I think I can do better and plan to incorporate some techniques such as creating tiny habits to get closer to my goals.  

##### Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
To help myself to move to my goals more smoothly I might create a tiny habit that anytime I load up my computer I will first check this site to accomplish a challenge before doing anything else.  

##### What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I think I can use a combination of breaking up course work into pomodoro's and create tiny habits in accomplishing a new pomodoro to different anchors that happen throughout the day for myself.

I plan to set aside time during the day to just focus on pomodoro's and using the time inbetween for reflection on the work accomplished.  During time that is not set aside for the purpose of focusing on pomodoro's I will create tiny habits to accomplish more.  Such as, anytime I finish eating a meal I will do another pomodoro.  Or if I watch a TV episode, I will do a pomodoro.




# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

##### What is a shell?
A shell executes commands. A shell allows execution of GNU commands and provides a set of built in commands such.  
##### What is "bash?"
Bash is a command language interpreter.  Also known as the 'bourne again shell'. It is the default shell for many operating systems.

 

##### What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
Changing directories to something very far down in a path using pushd.  (ex. i/like/icecream/it/is/very/tasty)  Reducing the number of paths and clearly defining them seems very important if you want to change through directories quickly.

 

##### Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
I was successful on using all the commands.

##### In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
I found the most useful to be select-string (grep) and viewing a file with less/MORE.  Redirection to create new files I thought was very important and would be very helpful.

 

##### Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

`pwd` = Print working directory

`ls` = list directory

`mv` = move a file or directory

`cd` = change directory

`../` = move up in a tree and path

`touch` (New-Item in windows) = create a empty file 

`mkdir` = make directory

`less` = page through a file

`rmdir` = remove directory

`rm`= remove a file

`help` = read a manual page





# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection 

##### If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one? 

###### Creating a Repo:

Click the "+" next to your avatar on GitHub.

select "New repository"

enter the name of your repository where it says "Repository name"

###### Creating a Fork:

Select a repository you wish to fork.

Click fork below your avatar.

Select your username.

###### Creating a clone:

Select repository you wish to clone.

On right side look for "HTTPS clone URL" and copy the url.

Open your command line.

Change directory on the command line to the one you wish to clone to.

Enter git clone < copied URL >

 
##### Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
Forking to a project could allow a user to play with and work on code without affecting the original.  They can also fork to a project to ultimately contribute to it.

 
##### What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I did not run into any specific struggles setting up git and GitHub.  Something I was worried about when creating a fork was that it would affect the master.  I feel more confident with playing around with GitHub now.

# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I learned about the pomodoro technique to really focus on a task for 25 minutes and take a 5 minute break and I learned about creating tiny habits to help achieve a major goal.  Time boxing is working an agreed period of time, alone or with a team, on a goal and stopping at the end of the time to reflect on what was accomplished in that period.  Currently I do not use any specific technique and have just focused on self motivation to accomplish tasks and goals.  While it has worked so far I think I can do better and plan to incorporate some techniques such as creating tiny habits to get closer to my goals.  To help myself to move to my goals more smoothly I might create a tiny habit that anytime I load up my computer I will first check this site to accomplish a challenge before doing anything else.  I think I can use a combination of breaking up course work into pomodoro's and create tiny habits in accomplishing a new pomodoro to different anchors that happen throughout the day for myself.




# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1. A shell executes commands. A shell allows execution of GNU commands and provides a set of built in commands such.  

Bash is a command language interpreter.  It is the default shell.

 

2. Changing directories to something very far down in a path using pushd.  (ex. i/like/icecream/it/is/very/tasty)  Reducing the number of paths and clearly defining them seems very important if you want to change through directories quickly.

 

3-4.  I was successful on using all the commands and found the most useful to be select-string (grep) and viewing a file with less/MORE.  Redirection to create new files I thought was very important and would be very helpful.

 

5.

-pwd = Print working directory

-ls = list directory

-mv = move a file or directory

-cd = change directory

-../ = move up in a tree and path

-touch (New-Item in windows) = create a empty file 

-mkdir = make directory

-less = page through a file

-rmdir = remove directory

-rm = remove a file

-help = read a manual page





# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection 

1.  

Creating a Repo:

Click the "+" next to your avatar on GitHub.

select "New repository"

enter the name of your repository where it says "Repository name"

Creating a Fork:

Select a repository you wish to fork.

Click fork below your avatar.

Select your username.

Creating a clone:

Select repository you wish to clone.

On right side look for "HTTPS clone URL" and copy the url.

Open your command line.

Change directory on the command line to the one you wish to clone to.

Enter git clone < copied URL >

 

Forking to a project could allow a user to play with and work on code without affecting the original.  They can also fork to a project to ultimately contribute to it.

 

2. I did not run into any specific struggles setting up git and GitHub.  Something I was worried about when creating a fork was that it would affect the master.  I feel more confident with playing around with GitHub now.

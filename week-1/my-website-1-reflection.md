##### Describe what open source means.

Open source is the practice of sharing how a program was made and allowing others to edit the program as they see fit.


##### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think open source is really amazing for most things.  But I can't help feel protective of my projects.  I think it would matter more if I was creating software I wished to sell like the Adobe Photoshop example.

##### Assess the importance of using licenses.

You don't give away your rights over your work and still hold the original copyright.  It gives permissions to people to use your work as seen fit, but to still provide credit to the original creator.

##### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Learning about open-source licensing.  I had always assumed that open source licensing meant that anything you put out there anybody could just copy it and claim it as their own.  It had made me initially feel very protective over my work and worrying about people just copying things I accomplished and claiming them as their own.

##### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
